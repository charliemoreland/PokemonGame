This was a semester long project for a class where I created a terminal pokemon game in c and then transferred it to c++ and took advantage of ncurses for UX.
The game has different types of trainers and different types of pokemon all of there stats are parsed in through csv files. The movement priority of all charactrers
on the map utilizes a priority queue that is implemented with the help of a heap. You are able to to move in 8 different directions different types of terraine have different movement cost.
There are trainer battles as well as wild pokemon batles that randomly happen when walking though tall grass.
